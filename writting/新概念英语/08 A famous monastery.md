The Great ST. Bernard Pass connects Switzerland to Italy. At 2,430 metres, the highest mountain pass in Europe.
The famous monastery of St. Bernard, which was founded in eleventh century, lies about a mile away. For hundreds of years, St. Bernard's dogs have saved lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass.
These friendly dogs were first brought from Asia, which were used as watchdogs even in Roman Times.Now that  a tunnel has been built through  the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is  in difficulty.
Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot. During the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars.As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure.
In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different.  The temperature drops to minus thirty degree and very few people attempt to  cross the Pass. The monks prefer winter to summer for they have more privacy. The dogs also have more freedom, they are allowed to wanter outside their enclosure.
The only visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter. These young people who love the peace of mountains also receive warm welcome from monastery at St. Bernard
