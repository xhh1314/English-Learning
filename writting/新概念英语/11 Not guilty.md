Customs Officers  are quite tolerant these days, but they  can still stop you when you  are going through the green channel and have  nothing to  declare. Even really honest people are made to guilty.

The hardened professional smuggler, on the other hand, is never troubled by such felling , even if they has  500 gold watches hidden in their suitcase. When I returned from abroad recently, a particular young customs officers clearly regarded me as a smuggler.
'Have you  have anything to declare?' he asked, looked at me.'no ', I answered confidently. 'Would you mind unlocking this suitcase please?', 'Not at all' I answered.
The officer went through the case with great care, All the things I had packed so carefully were soon in a dreadful mess. I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again.
Suddenly, I saw the Officer's face light up. He had spotted a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case and he pounced on it with delight. 'Perfume?' he asked sarcastically
'You should have declared that, perfume is not exempt from import duty', 'But it's not perfume' I said. 'It's hair gel', then  I added  with smile, 'it's a strange mixture made by myself ', but as I expected that he did't believed what I said. 'Try it ' I said encouragingly, the Officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils.
He was greeted by a unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth. A few minutes later, I was able to hurry  away with precious chalk marks on my baggage.
