how do cats try to protect themselves when falling from great heights.
Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. They can be friendly and affectionate towards human, but they lead mysterious lives of their own as well.
They never become submissive like horse or dog, as result, human learn to respect their feline independence. Most cats remain suspicious of humans  all their lives.
One of the things that  fascinate us most about cats is the popular belief that cats have nine lives.
Apparently, there is a good deal of truth in this idea. The cat's ability to survive from fall is based on facts.
Recently the New York Animal Medical Center made a study of  132 cats over a period of  five mouths. All these cats had one experience in common, that they had fallen of  high buildings , and only eight of them died from shock or injuries.
Of course, New York is a ideal place for such an interesting study, because there is no shortage of tall buildings. There are plenty of high-rise windowsills to fall from.

one cat Sabrina, fell 32 storeys, yet only suffered from a broken tooth, 'cat's behave like a trained paratroopers ', said a doctor.
It seems that the further they fall, the less they are likely to hurt themselves. In a long drop, they reach 60 miles an hour and more. In  high speeds, they can have time to relax, they stretch out their legs like flying squirrels. It can increase air-resistance and reduce the shock of  impact when they hit ground.
