our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has  never managed to get  enough money to have the church clock repaired. The big clock which used to  strike hours day and night was damaged many years and has been silent ever since.
One night, the vicar woken up with a start that the clock was striking the hours, then he looked at his watch, it was  one o'clock ,but the clock had been struck thirteen times before it stopped

Armed with a torch ,the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on, in the torchlight she caught  sight of a figure whom he  immediately recognized as  Bill, our local grocer
"Whatever are you doing up here Bill",asked the vicar in surprise,"I'm trying to repair the  bell ",answered Bill."I have been coming up here night after night for weeks,You see,I was hoping to give you a surprise  ",answered Bell .

"It's working right well, but I'm afraid that at one o'clock every night the bell will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it  ",the vicar said,"we'll get used to that "

"thirteen is not as good as one, but it is better than nothing, now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea "
