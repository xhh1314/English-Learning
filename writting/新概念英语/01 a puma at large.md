when reports came into Landon Zoo that a wild animal had been spotted forty-five miles south of Landon ,they were not  taken seriously .
however as the evidence began to accumulate ,the experts from the Zoo obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were  extraordinarily similar.The hunt for puma began with a small village where a women picking blackberries saw a large cut only five yards away from her.

It immediately ran away when it saw her, the experts confirmed puma will not attack human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place tweety miles away in the evening
Whenever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small  animals like rabbits.Paw prints were seen in a number of places  and puma fur was found clinging to bushes
