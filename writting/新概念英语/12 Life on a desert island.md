What was the exceptional about the two man's stay on the desert island?
Most of us have a unrealistic imagine about desert island, may be which is a sort of paradise

Most of us have formed a unrealistic picture of life on a desert island. We sometimes imagine a desert island to be a sort of paradise where the sun always shines.Life in there is simple and good, ripe food fall from the tree and you never  have  to work.
The other side of picture  is quite opposite, you either starve to death  or live like Robinson, waiting for a  boat which never comes.

The other side of picture is quite opposite, Live on desert island is wretched. you either starve to death or live like Robinson, waiting for a boat which never comes.Perhaps there is a  element of  truth in both these pictures, but few of us had a opportunity to find out.  

Two man who recently spent five days on a coral island wished they had stayed there longer.They were taking a badly damaged boat from A TO Miami to have it repaired, during the journey, the boat  began to sink. They quickly loaded a rubber dinghy with food , matches, cans of beer and rowed for a few miles across the A and until they arrived at a coral desert island. There were hardly any  trees and there was no water, but this did't prove to be a problem. They collected  water by rubber dinghy , As they had  brought  a gun with them, so they have plenty to eat.
They caught lobster and fish every day, and as one of they put it 'ate like a king', when a passing tanker rescued them five days later, both they were genuinely sorry that they have to leave.
