The great ship, Titanic, sailed for New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912. The ship carried  1,316 passengers and a crew of 819.

Even by modern standards, the 46,000 ton Titanic was a colossal ship. At that time, she was not only the largest ship in the world, but was regard as unsinkable, for she had sixteen watertight compartments, even if two of these were flooded, she would still be able to float. The tragic sinking of this great liner will always be remembered, for she went down on her first voyage with heavy loss of life.

Four days after setting out, she was  sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic, suddenly a huge iceberg was spotted by a lookout. After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned sharply to avoid a direct collision. The Titanic turned just in time, narrowly missing the immense wall of ice  which rose over 100 foot out of the water beside her.Suddenly, there was a slight trembling sound from blow, the captain went down  to see what had happened. The nose had been so faint and no one thought that the ship had been damaged. The captain realized his horror that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded.
The order to abandon the ship was given and hundreds of people plunged into the icy water. As there were not enough lifeboats for everybody, 1,500 lives were lost.
